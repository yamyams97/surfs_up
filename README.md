# surfs_up

# Overview 
This project explores the temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii by using advanced data storage and retrieval. We were tasked specifically to provide a summary statistic for the months of June and December. All of this was to help determine if a surf and ice cream shop can be a viable business year round, as opposed to just a seasonal business. 

# Results

## December vs. June 

According to our data, there is only a 3 degrees difference in average temperature between the month of June and December. That acounts for just about a 6% decrease in average temperature from June to December. However, the standard deviation of the December temperatures, along with a much lower minimum temperature lead me to believe that there is more variability in the month of December than there is in June. 

## Final Summary 

I would summarize to W. Avy, that even though there is more variability in temperatures during the month of December than there is in June, December would still provide great weather conditions for ice cream and surfing. The average temperatures only differ by about 4 degrees, and the median temperature is around 72 degrees through years of recordings! Those are more than optimal temperatures to enjoy a nice scoop of ice cream!

Before making a final decision though, I would also reccomend looking at two more factors. Tracking the rain patterns, and wave pattern of the ocean for the months of December should also factor into making this business decision. If the wave patterns aren't optimal, there won't be any surfers around to surf, and if the temperatures are high, but it is raining, people won't be out to enjoy some ice cream either! So those would be two more things I would look into before making a final decision.
