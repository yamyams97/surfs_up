# Overview 
This project explores the temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii by using advanced data storage and retrieval. We were tasked specifically to provide a summary statistic for the months of June and December. All of this was to help determine if a surf and ice cream shop can be a viable business year round, as opposed to just a seasonal business.
